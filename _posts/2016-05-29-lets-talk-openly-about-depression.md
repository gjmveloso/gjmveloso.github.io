**3 months and 23 days ago** I was diagnosed with a [major depression disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder){:target="blank"} after months living with what I've thought it was just a _normal_ - and not so _happy_ - mood.

Living in Chile made things a little bit harder. Chile is famous for being the most seismic country in the World, for having a plenty on cheap and good wines and for having some of the [most beautiful landscapes in the World to visit](https://vimeo.com/36519586){:target="blank"}.
