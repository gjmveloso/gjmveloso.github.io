Last week I finally bought a new personal computer. My 2008's _Vostro_ computer was too old and its battery lasts for around 15 minutes unplugged. Since my complete move to Ubuntu on 2011 I was thinking about making the switch to a Mac computer when I got a chance.

Buying Apple devices in Brazil are just for rich people. Or dummies. [The $1,299 new MacBook](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook){:target="blank"} __[costs $ 2,200](http://www.apple.com/br/shop/buy-mac/macbook){:target="blank"}__ as [today's exchange rate](https://www.google.com/search?q=8499%20brl%20in%20usd&rct=j){:target="blank"}. In Chile it's much more reasonable [costing $1,535](http://www.maconline.com/catalogo/859-New_MacBook.html){:target="blank"} as [today's rate](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&q=1049990%20clp%20in%20usd&rct=j){:target="blank"}.

So I got one :)

As a newcomer I was completely lost with the Multi-Touch and gestures thing. Also the Control, Option, Command differences. The main purpose of investing on a such expensive computer was to start learning _iOS_ Development with Swift which is [a beautiful and modern language that will be open sourced later this year](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=29){:target="blank"}. I think Apple have built one of the most thrilling Developers Communities in the world and I expect Swift to become a really great language to work with - not only because _iOS_, _watchOS_ and _tvOS_ Development but also because its potential to change Web and Enterprise Software Development.

So as a developer the first thing I did when turned on my new computer was to **install developer tools**.

#### Console

Everything starts with a good console. Mac come with a lot of languages and tools installed by default and the  standard _bash shell_ is good enough. But you're just one command line away to get [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/){:target="blank"}, then [Cask](http://caskroom.io/){:target="blank"}, then [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/){:target="blank"}. **With this combination I have the best console experience ever**. Everything is explicit, informational and you can accomplish so much without any custom settings or additional plugins. It just works.

#### Text Editor

[GitHub's Atom](https://atom.io/){:target="blank"} was already my favorite text editor on Linux and Windows. And packages like [go-plus](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus){:target="blank"}, [react](https://atom.io/packages/react){:target="blank"}, [turbo-javascript](https://atom.io/packages/turbo-javascript){:target="blank"}, [omnisharp](https://atom.io/packages/omnisharp-atom){:target="blank"}, [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify){:target="blank"}, [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons){:target="blank"}, [merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts){:target="blank"}, [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments){:target="blank"}, [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter){:target="blank"} ([select your language(s) here](https://atomlinter.github.io)), [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap){:target="blank"}, [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet){:target="blank"}, [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html){:target="blank"}, [autocomplete-paths](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-paths){:target="blank"} and [script](https://atom.io/packages/script){:target="blank"} provides everything I need to work and to have some extra fun.

#### Xcode

Some parts of Xcode will be required by [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/){:target="blank"} but as I wanted to start playing with _iOS_ Developmemt I need to install the complete version. Everything available from the App Store. Swift Playground is remarkable and fun. The IDE is so clear and focused that sometimes I think something is missing. A complete new different way to write code that is fun and easy.

#### Additional software

It's also good to mention that additional software are also vastly available. It comes with Pages, Keynote and Numbers but you can also install [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/){:target="blank"} which is really well crafted for OS X. Chrome, Skype and Spotify (for my long programming sessions) are available as expected.

#### Bonus: iOS Learning Resources

There are a lot of _iOS_ Development courses available on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ios){:target="blank"} and [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/search?q=ios){:target="blank"}. Additionally, some high-quality and free courses are available on [iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/app/itunes-u/id490217893?mt=8){:target="blank"}.

Also well written official [reference books for Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11){:target="blank"} and [Cocoa](https://itunes.apple.com/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id888894773?mt=11){:target="blank"} are available on iBooks Store for free. I got the reference books and also enrolled to [PUCRS' iOS Development in Swift]( https://itunes.apple.com/course/ios-development-in-swift/id949983067){:target="blank"} - a carefully series of video lessons that are on my native language (with English subtitles available) that worth watching.
