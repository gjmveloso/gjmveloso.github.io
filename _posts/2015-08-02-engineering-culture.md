Since [Mark Zuckerberg's 2012 annual letter](http://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/)
to Facebook investors I've been interested on how [culture drives businesses](http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04).
Especially, _tech businesses_.

Since last year after reading [Dave Thomas' post about it's time to kill agile](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/)
I was looking for _engineering culture_ examples. **Relying on culture instead of on processes, methods and tools is easier.
And lasts for more time**.

Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Rackspace and Netflix have really good _engineering culture principles_. **Spotify engineering culture is my favorite**. Take some time to see these two videos ;)

##### Common foundation of great engineering cultures

**1. Trust**

Software Engineering is a perfect mix of science and __craft__. To promote craftsmanship you need to trust on your people. As stated by Laszlo Bock on his [amazing Work Rules! book](http://www.workrules.net): _"Give people slightly more trust, freedom and authority than you are comfortable giving them. If you're not nervous, you haven't given then enough."_

**2. Shared sense of responsibility**

Companies with strong cultures have employees that act as founders. They aren't there only for money. They're moved by a purpose and by improving his craft. Quoting one of the signs at Facebook HQ, _"no problem is someone else's problem"_. It's that time someone provide a link to [Daniel Pink's 2009 TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y), right?

**3. Diversity**

A strong culture generally started on early stages of a company and does not change a lot along the way. Counterintuitively how do you implement your culture and how your culture touches all daily activities of your company could change all the time until you get it right. And that's fine. Implementing powerful cultures requires an environment that truly embraces diversity of all kinds. **Diversity is the key for keeping your culture alive and updated**.

**4. Practice-oriented**

The way people conceive, build and deliver software is constantly changing. The _state of the art_ and the _status quo_ simply does not exist. **Pragmatic cultures works. Dogmas don't**.

**5. Tailor-made**

_"One size does not fit all"_ and ["There is no silver bullet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) are classic quotes in Software Engineering. They're also true for establishing a engineering culture. Well known engineering cultures are a good point of start and serve more as an inspiration than as a guideline. Before start implementing your engineering culture take a break and discover what makes your organization unique.
