On [August of last year I've shared some thoughts about Engineering Culture](/2015/08/02/engineering-culture){:target="blank"}, with some good examples and an intent to extract foundations of great company cultures: __Trust__, __Shared sense of responsibility__, __*Practice-oriented*__, __*Tailor-made*__ and __Diversity__.

Since then I've been experiencing a lot of new and challenging changes on my career and on my [personal life]("/2016/05/29/lets-talk-openly-about-depression"){:target="blank"}. Looking them retrospectively and with an _extra nudge_ from one of my greatest professional references I've started thinking and [reading](https://sgeinternational.com/culture-hacking-is-a-business-thing/){:target="blank"} [more](https://hbr.org/2016/06/what-it-takes-to-innovate-within-a-corporate-bureaucracy){:target="blank"} about when culture (engineering or your broader company culture) could (or should) be _hacked_ - [_hacking_ in the constructive meaning of the term](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/02/zuck-letter/){:target="blank"}.

### Signs your culture needs to be _hacked_

#### 1. It's still [tacit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge){:target="blank"}

Culture tends to start organically on startup days of every company but it should be [explicit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_knowledge){:target="blank"} after. When you got bigger you'll need to write your culture down to something **really available to your entire team**. Your **core values** should be explicit on every situation and on every department - R&D, HR, Finance or Marketing, everywhere.

#### 2. The executive team does not support it **entirely**

_Culture is the most important asset of any company - even more than people. People leaves, are fired, or die. **Your company culture will live forever**_

All strong cultures out there are sponsored by C-level executives. No culture will survive if not supported and applied by your top executive team. Drive a company by its culture is easier but it's still hard - and even harder when the hard times are in place.

The easy days will be easy. When the things are going bad your culture should shine - **rest assured, if you give your company culture a chance it will bring the great times back.**

#### 3. It's not getting job done

Sometimes your culture is in place but it's simply outdated and need some _tuning_. Great cultures embraces change when change is required. Awesome cultures are [**_tailor-made_ and _practice-oriented_**](/2015/08/02/engineering-culture){:target="blank"}.


### _Hacking_ your company culture

>"For individuals, character is destiny. For organizations, culture is destiny." - Tony Hsieh, [Zappos](https://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/tag/core-values){:target="blank"} CEO

#### 1. Be humble, be [kind](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-field/kindness-research_b_7054652.html){:target="blank"}

_Hacking a culture_ is not easy and have a **huge room to be misunderstood**. **Be humble. Be kind**. You're not the only individual that is trying to help your company succeed. And you could be driven by the wrong assumptions.

#### 2. Share your _hacking plan_ with people you trust - even your boss. Or your boss' boss.

**_Hacking_ a culture is risky**. If you really want to do that do it openly. It's better (and safer) to do it together with people you trust. And they probably will help you. Again, **you're not alone on the continuous effort of making your company the greatest place it could be**.

#### 3. Baby Steps

You got it: it's hard and risky. Given that **start small, test and refactor. Repeat.**

#### 4. Plan for the sad path

_Hacking_ a culture is closer to a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game){:target="blank"} rather than _win-win agreements_. People will point you if you fail. And let's say: _Hacking_ a culture is hard and risky. Be prepared, bad things will happen on the road.

#### 5. Plan for the happy path

Let's use [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle){:target="blank"}? You will fail 80% of the time you try to _hack_ your culture. If you achieve the lucky 20%, be prepared to *go big*. You will need to evangelize your _recently tuned_ culture everywhere. **It will not be that risky anymore but it's still hard.**

_Happy Hacking!_ ðŸ¤“
